# Crassus Basic
This is the layout for the Crassus initial website. It was built using pure html and css, and deployed with GitHub pages.

This is what I learned:
- Flexbox
- Differentiate when to use anchors and buttons.
- Some semantic HTML tags.
- Some css selectors like: class, descendant combinator, universal and type.
- Reset the browser styles
- Add transparency to the argb colors.
- Use background images
- Basic animations with hover.
- Responsive design
- Use media query
